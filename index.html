                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>Child Care South Africa is a community based initiative which seeks to enhance the capacity of
                        families and community
                        structures in South Africa to provide quality care to children and youth, access relevant
                        government services; protect
                        the dignity of children and develop the self-esteem, talents and skills of children and youth.
                        Child Care South Africa
                        was formally registered as a Non-profit organisation in August 2000.</p>
                    <p>At Child Care South Africa, we believe that children are the very essence of the future. Who they
                        are tomorrow is
                        essentially the outcome of how they are raised and nurtured today. We go above and beyond to
                        provide our youth an
                        empowering environment where they can fully embrace their identity and gain all the skills they
                        need to be leaders
                        tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>We strive to create a society where children and youth have the opportunities and encouragement
                        to develop into
                        responsible, self-sufficient adults who are able to contribute positively to society and break
                        the cycle of poverty.</p>
